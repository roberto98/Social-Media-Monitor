They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins.

The point is,\\n#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n\\nNo, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\nwith *some* fanaticism.
